\begin{question}
In the following code, determine the type of each variable
and the value each variable has when the code finishes:
\begin{lstlisting}
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a
reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.
That is, if \verb|i| is an \verb|int|, then the type of the expression \verb|i = x| is \verb|int&|. Using
that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:
\begin{lstlisting}
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Describe the differences in type deduction between
\verb|decltype| and \verb|auto|. Give an example of an expression where \verb|auto| and
\verb|decltype| will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce
differing types.
\end{question}
