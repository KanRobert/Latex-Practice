\begin{question}
Write a program to read \verb|strings| from standard input
looking for duplicated words. The program should find places in the input
where one word is followed immediately by itself. Keep track of the largest
number of times a single repetition occurs and which word is repeated. Print
the maximum number of duplicates, or else print a message saying that no
word was repeated. For example, if the input is
\begin{codeout}
how now now now brown cow cow
\end{codeout}
the output should indicate that the word \verb|now| occurred three times.
