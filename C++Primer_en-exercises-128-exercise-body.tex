\begin{question}
Assuming class \verb|D1| on page \pageref{lst:the definition of base d1 and d2} had intended to override
its inherited \verb|fcn| function, how would you fix that class? Assuming you fixed
the class so that \verb|fcn| matched the definition in \verb|Base|, how would the calls in
that section be resolved?
\end{question}
