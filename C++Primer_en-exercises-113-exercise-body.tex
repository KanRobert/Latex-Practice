\begin{question}
What are the constraints on the iterators that form iterator ranges?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write a function that takes a pair of iterators to a
\verb|vector<int>| and an \verb|int| value. Look for that value in the range and return
a \verb|bool| indicating whether it was found.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Rewrite the previous program to return an iterator to the
requested element. Note that the program must handle the case where the
element is not found.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What is wrong with the following program? How might you correct it?
\begin{lstlisting}
list<int> lst1;
list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(), iter2 = lst1.end();
while (iter1 < iter2)
   /* ... */
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}
