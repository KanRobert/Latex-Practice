\begin{question}
What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Given the declarations for \verb|f| from page \pageref{lst:multiple functions namd f}, list the viable
functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the
best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call
is ambiguous.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
^^I\item \verb|f(2.56, 42)|
^^I\item \verb|f(42)|
^^I\item \verb|f(42, 0)|
^^I\item \verb|f(2.56, 3.14)|
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write all four versions of \verb|f|. Each function should print a
distinguishing message. Check your answers for the previous exercise. If your
answers were incorrect, study this section until you understand why your
answers were wrong.
