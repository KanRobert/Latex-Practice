\begin{question}
Using the variable definitions from this section, determine
what happens in each of these assignments:
\begin{lstlisting}
a = 42; b = 42; c = 42;
d = 42; e = 42; g = 42;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write a program containing the variables and assignments
from the previous exercise. Print the variables before and after the
assignments to check whether your predictions in the previous exercise were
correct. If not, study the examples until you can convince yourself you know
what led you to the wrong conclusion.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Determine the types deduced in each of the following
definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see
whether you were correct.
\begin{lstlisting}
const int i = 42;
auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;
const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}
