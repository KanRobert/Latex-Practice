\begin{question}
Rewrite your own version of the \verb|Sales_data| class to use
delegating constructors. Add a statement to the body of each of the
constructors that prints a message whenever it is executed. Write
declarations to construct a \verb|Sales_data| object in every way possible. Study
the output until you are certain you understand the order of execution among
delegating constructors.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
For the class you wrote for exercise \ref{chap:classes}.\ref{qst:determine what data are needed in the following abstractions} in \S~\ref{par:default arguments and constructors} (p. \pageref{par:default arguments and constructors}),
decide whether any of the constructors might use delegation. If so, write the
delegating constructor(s) for your class. If not, look at the list of abstractions
and choose one that you think would use a delegating constructor. Write the
class definition for that abstraction.
\end{question}
