\begin{question}
Write a program to print the size and contents of the
\verb|vector|s from exercise \thechapter.\ref{qst:vector elements}. Check whether your answers to that exercise
were correct. If not, restudy \S~\ref{subsec:defining and initializing vectors} (p. \pageref{subsec:defining and initializing vectors}) until you understand why you
were wrong.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Read a sequence of words from \verb|cin| and store the values a
\verb|vector|. After youâ€™ve read all the words, process the \verb|vector| and change
each word to uppercase. Print the transformed elements, eight words to a
line.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?
\begin{lstlisting}
vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
List three ways to define a \verb|vector| and give it ten elements,
each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so
and why.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Read a set of integers into a \verb|vector|. Print the sum of each
pair of adjacent elements. Change your program so that it prints the sum of
the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-tolast,
and so on.
\end{question}
