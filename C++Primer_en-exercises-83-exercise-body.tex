\begin{question}
Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in \S~\ref{qst:a recursive function to print the contents of a vector} (p. \pageref{qst:a recursive function to print the contents of a vector})
that used recursion to print the contents of a \verb|vector| to conditionally
print information about its execution. For example, you might print the size of
the \verb|vector| on each call. Compile and run the program with debugging
turned on and again with it turned off.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of \verb|assert|:
\begin{lstlisting}
string s;
while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body
assert(cin);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}
