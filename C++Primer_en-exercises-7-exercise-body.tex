\begin{question}
What happens in the program presented in this section if the
input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Compile and run the program from this section giving it only
equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is
repeated.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Revise the program you wrote for the exercises in \S~\ref{subsec:the while statement} (p.
