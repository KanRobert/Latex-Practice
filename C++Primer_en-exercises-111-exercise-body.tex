\begin{question}
 Which is the most appropriate—a \verb|vector|, a \verb|deque|, or a
\verb|list|—for the following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice.
If there is no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
^^I\item Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container
alphabetically as they are entered. We’ll see in the next chapter that
associative containers are better suited to this problem.
^^I\item Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the
back. Remove the next value from the front.
^^I\item Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and
then print them to standard output.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
