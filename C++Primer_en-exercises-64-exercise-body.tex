\begin{question}
Write a program to read a sequence of \verb|string|s from the
standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all
the words have been read. Use a \verb|while| loop to read the text one word at a
time. Use the \verb|break| statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice
in succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a
message saying that no word was repeated.
\end{question}
