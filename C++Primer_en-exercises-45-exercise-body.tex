\begin{question}
Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy
presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in
the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an
acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?
