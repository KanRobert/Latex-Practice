\begin{question}
Add the \verb|move|, \verb|set|, and \verb|display| operations to your
version of \verb|Screen|. Test your class by executing the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
Screen myScreen(5, 5, 'X');
myScreen.move(4,0).set('#').display(cout);
cout << "\n";
myScreen.display(cout);
cout << "\n";
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What would happen in the previous exercise if the return
type of \verb|move|, \verb|set|, and \verb|display| was \verb|Screen| rather than \verb|Screen&|?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Revise your Screen class so that \verb|move|, \verb|set|, and \verb|display|
functions return \verb|Screen| and check your prediction from the previous
exercise.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the
\verb|this| pointer. Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the \verb|this| pointer
to access members.
\end{question}
