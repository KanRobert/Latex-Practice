Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
\begin{lstlisting}
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
\end{lstlisting}
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why
not? How would you fix it?
