\begin{question}
Given the classes from page \pageref{lst:public and private inherit} and page \pageref{lst:derived from public and private}, and
assuming each object has the type specified in the comments, determine
which of these assignments are legal. Explain why those that are illegal arenâ€™t allowed:
\begin{lstlisting}
Base *p = &d1; // d1 has type Pub_Derv
p = &d2; // d2 has type Priv_Derv
p = &d3; // d3 has type Prot_Derv
p = &dd1; // dd1 has type Derived_from_Public
p = &dd2; // dd2 has type Derived_from_Private
p = &dd3; // dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Assume that each of the classes from page \pageref{lst:public and private inherit} and page
\pageref{lst:derived from public and private} has a member function of the form:
\begin{lstlisting}
void memfcn(Base &b) { b = *this; }
\end{lstlisting}
For each class, determine whether this function would be legal.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write code to test your answers to the previous two exercises.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Choose one of the following general abstractions containing
a family of types (or choose one of your own). Organize the types into an
inheritance hierarchy:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
^^I\item Graphical file formats (such as gif, tiff, jpeg, bmp)
^^I\item Geometric primitives (such as box, circle, sphere, cone)
^^I\item C++ language types (such as class, function, member function)
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
For the class you chose in the previous exercise, identify
some of the likely virtual functions as well as \verb|public| and \verb|protected| members.
\end{question}
