\begin{question}
Assume that \verb|numbered| is a class with a default constructor
that generates a unique serial number for each object, which is stored in a
data member named \verb|mysn|. Assuming \verb|numbered| uses the synthesized copy-control
members and given the following function:
\begin{lstlisting}
void f (numbered s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }
numbered a, b = a, c = b;
f(a); f(b); f(c);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Assume \verb|numbered| has a copy constructor that generates a
new serial number. Does that change the output of the calls in the previous
exercise? If so, why? What output gets generated?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What if the parameter in f were \verb|const| \verb|numbered&|?
Does that change the output? If so, why? What output gets generated?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write versions of \verb|numbered| and \verb|f| corresponding to the
previous three exercises and check whether you correctly predicted the
output.
\end{question}
